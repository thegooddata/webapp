Aggregate or anonymous Service data are not considered PII. Service Users are those individuals that install our browser extension and enjoy any of our Services, as described in our Terms of Use.</p>

                                    <p>Being a data cooperative, we aim to gather the anonymous Service data that you produce in order to help you enjoy the value of it. At this time, this data consists of online behavioral and interest data, such as browsing history and search queries.</p>
                                    <p>This data will only be stored if you give us your permission to do so. You will be able to enjoy our Services regardless of your decision to let us store this data or not.</p>
                                    <p>Raw online behavioral data will be automatically deleted if older than three months. Estimated and aggregated behavioral and interest data may be kept for longer only if it remains valid and commercially valuable.</p>

                                    <p>In case we find a third party interested on your anonymous data, we will only provide access to it if you have previously given us permission to do so. This permission will be limited to a certain type of data, for a limited time period and for a type of third party. This permission may contain certain terms limits (minimum benefit expected, etc).

                                    <p>If you apply to become a cooperative Member, we will request the minimum PII required by law for identifying and registering you as a Member. Once you become a Member, we will encrypt the link between your PII and your Service data with two-man rule techniques. This means that we will know that someone has visited certain website, but will not be able to know his/her personal details. This is why we will from this point forward address you by your username.</p>
                                    <p>Only our Membership Committee will be able to de-anonymize your Service data if we are legally forced to do so, or if you terminate your Membership, or if you are expelled as a Member. In the latter two cases all your data will immediately be deleted after being de-encrypted.</p>
                                    <p>Only your email address will remain attached to your Service data. It will be used both for password recovery as well as to send you company announcements. This is the only PII that for operative purposes cannot be detached from your Service data; if you are worried about your anonymity, we recommend you to use a non-personally identifiable email address.</p>
                                    <p>We may use MailChimp to manage some of our email communications with cooperative Members. There is no third-party tracking present in messages that we send through MailChimp except for MailChimp’s own analytics, which may aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links within emails.

                                <p>TheGoodData is a cooperative of Customers that aim to help its Members to regain ownership over the data that they produce. This implies supporting them in identifying, gathering, producing, securing and/or processing the data that they directly or indirectly collaborate to generate, as well as supporting them to keep it private if they choose to do so, or trade it, or to set up services that trade it with corporations, administrations or other Customers in exchange for a financial benefit and/or any other tangible or intangible benefit.</p>

                                <p>By regaining data ownership, Customers will have more freedom of choice, more negotiation power and ultimately will ultimately be more satisfied and happier in their relationships with corporations.</p>

                                <div class="description"><strong>People are the only owners of the data they produce</strong>. This means that they must be aware of its existence, that they can freely decide who should have access to it and set the terms and benefits to be received in exchange. All these decisions should be presented to the people in an easy and understandable way.</div>
                            </div>

Customers will gain freedom of choice, a more balanced position when dealing with corporations, and a higher value in exchange for the data they decide to share, if any. Data can therefore be Good for Customers.</div>
