		Hi [FIRST_NAME],
		<p>Marcos here, founder and Director at TheGoodData. I’m happy to tell you that your application to become Member of the company has been accepted!</p>
		<p>Now, according to the Industrial and Provident Society Act, you have to formally get your share of the company. You can do it by following <a href="[SHARE_URL]">this link</a>. You will not be a Member until you get this single share.</p>
		<p>Once you have it, you can follow our progress and participate in the company through our <a href="https://collaborate.thegooddata.org">platform</a>. Winning back the ownership of our data is something that can only be done with the collaboration of many of us, so I’m willing to see you there!</p>
		<p>For any doubt or suggestion you can catch me on Hangout or drop me an email. My personal account for both cases is <a href="mailto:marcos@thegooddata.org">marcos@thegooddata.org</a></p>

		<p>Best,</p>
		<p>Marcos Menéndez</p>
