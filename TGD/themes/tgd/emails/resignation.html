        Hello,
        <p>You have requested to resign your membership of The Good Data Cooperative Limited. This has two simple implications:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will no longer have any right to participate in the governance of the company: you will not be able to attend to General meetings or participate in our collaboration platform.</li>
            <li>By law, you will be entitled to sell us back the share you bought of The Good Data Cooperative Ltd. In case that we have lent you the money to get this share, by clicking on the link below this loan will be cancelled in exchange of the share that will from then on owned by the company. If you had paid us for this share, you should send us an email to <a href="mailto:members@thegooddata.org">members@thegooddata.org</a> giving your personal and payment details to get that money back. If we don’t receive any email in the next 3 months after resignation, we will assume that you have donated that 1 pence to The Good Data Cooperative Ltd.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Knowing these implications, if you still want to resign your membership, please <a href="[RESIGNATION_LINK]">click here</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve done so, I would appreciate that you write me back explaining what went wrong. It would help us to improve our service.</p>0
        <p>Yours Faithfully,</p>
        <p>Marcos Menendez</p>
